<h1>
Analogy
</h1>
<p>My fortress analogy is very simple. The fortress is surrounded by a uncrossable moat. 
<br>The only way in is through the drawbridge and once your in there are guards that catch and eliminate hackers from the system.
<br>If they try to go kill the king(Software) they find a suprise. They king is acutely a war machine and elimanates the hackers.
